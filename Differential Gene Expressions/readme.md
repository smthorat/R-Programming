Please download the gene count file and install the necessary libraries such as DESeq2, apeglm, ggplot2. 

Step by step explanations:
	1	Check if the BiocManager package is installed, and if not, install it.
	2	Install the DESeq2 and apeglm packages from Bioconductor using BiocManager.
	3	Load the DESeq2 library, which is used for differential gene expression analysis.
	4	Load the apeglm library, used for shrinking the effect size estimates (log fold changes).
	5	Set the working directory to the user's desktop.
	6	Define the path for a new working directory on the desktop.
	7	Check if the working directory exists; if it doesn't, create it.
	8	Change the working directory to the newly defined working directory.
	9	Read the RNA-Seq count data from a CSV file into a data frame.
	10	Convert the count data to integer format, which is required by DESeq2.
	11	Create a factor variable that categorizes samples into control and treated groups.
	12	Create a DESeqDataSet object, which will be used for differential expression analysis.
	13	Save the differential expression analysis results to a CSV file.
	14	Load the ggplot2 library, which is used for creating plots and visualizations.
	15	Create a volcano plot to visualize the relationship between log fold changes and adjusted p-values.
	16	Display the volcano plot, showing significant changes in gene expression.

The script performs differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data using the DESeq2 package, identifying genes with significant expression changes between control and treated groups. It then visualizes the results with a volcano plot, highlighting genes with significant log fold changes and adjusted p-values.
